thought we could handle views with plain node js 
but I was wrong
There's no way to handle views with plain node js
The reason express was developed was to add views on the project
So to sum up--> with vanila node we cant create views
To create views we have to use template engine and to use template
engine we have to use express



The only way to use template engines to create views is through express

Express also requires us to use templating engine to create our HTML files to dynamically
inject values into these files
